# PAY ATTENTION

Note: It's still under development. Please wait for the stable version v1.x.x

Note: It's not optimized, and so may be slow. Please avoid doing intensive computation on this database

For some reason, I just restructured the project structure, and separated the repo into

1. `node-jql`, which contains the JSON definition of SQL statements

2. `node-jql-core`, which contains the core of the JQL database

# node-jql-core

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-jql-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-jql-core)

This is a SQL database mainly designed for providing an interface for JSON processing with the SQL syntax.
